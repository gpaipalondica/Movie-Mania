Movie Mania: A responsive webpage showcasing different movies along with its details like title, description and genre along with a thumbnail and background image. Once clicked on More Info, you can see more details like IMDb ratings, more images, Actors, Directos etc.

This is a part of my react project called Project of Projects. 
This repo has only Movie Mania code and not the whole project
